# This is an implementation of a number guessing game that generates a number between the range of 1 and a specified max number. The game prompts players for their username. Range is set as function parameter and the player is prompted to predict the generated number between the given range. At a correct guess, the game awards the player a point and moves them to stage 2 by increasing the maximum range value by 1, e.g. range is from 1 and 3 for stage 2 and so on.
